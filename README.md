# Data-Analysis-1

## Description
The **water_potability.csv** file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. Consequently, the goal is to build models in order to predict water quality/potability (1 means
Potable and 0 means Not potable). 
Our tasks are to:
* Explore and describe the data (i.e., standard descriptive statistics, visualize the variables with different graphs, draw distributions and histograms of variables, are there outliers? Any interesting observation? Any correlations? Etc.)
* Pre-process the data (i.e., handle and fill unknowns if there are any, etc.)
* Build one model for predicting water quality, using the training data (You may need to
split the dataset.)
* Evaluate the accuracy of the model using the test data (You may need to split the
dataset.)
