# Discussion notes

## 20th March
  - Ask professor if the dataset is correct (based on the level of contaminants affecting potability).
  - ### Preprocessing:
    - Remove outliers
    - Replace null value with mean
    - Perform feature scaling

## 21st March
  - Professor said we can first remove the incorrect datas from the dataset. Then analyse both the modified and non modified datasets to provide a result
  - He also said that we can devide the dataset based on the serial number and consider that as a stream. 

## 4th April
  - Link analysis (link based on the ph) + similarities
  - Some basic ML algorithms:
      - Logistic regression
      - Decision Tree + Random Forest
      - SVM or Naive Bayes
  - We can analize both datasets with the mean for the null values or with removed rows
